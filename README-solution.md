To start `npm install`

To test the program against the .txt files provided: `npm test`

There are two files, main (koho.js) and test (koho.test.js).

The `mainTransaction()` function in the main koho.js is the main function while all the rest of the functions are helper functions.

The test file contains a full program run against the data set as well as some individual unit tests (as many as I could do in the time).

I'd be happy to have any feedback!
